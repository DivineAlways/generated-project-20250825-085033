# Project Overview

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a project to create an interactive web-based presentation exploring the complex relationships between God, consciousness, and technology. The source material is a comprehensive analysis covering theological, historical, cultural, and scientific perspectives on these topics.

The final product is a static, single-page application that allows users to navigate and read through the analysis in a clean, modern, and accessible interface.

## 2. Core Content

The application's content is structured around the following key themes from the source text:

-   **Theological Perspectives**: Examining definitions of God and the divine origins of consciousness.
-   **Historical Context**: Tracing the evolution of thought from ancient philosophy to modern neuroscience.
-   **Cultural Interpretations**: Contrasting Eastern and Western views and the impact of technology on spirituality.
-   **Contemporary Debates**: Delving into the philosophy of mind and the implications of Artificial Intelligence.
-   **Speculative Futures**: Considering the potential convergence of human consciousness, technology, and spirituality.

## 3. Project Goals

-   To faithfully represent the source analysis in a digital format.
-   To create an intuitive and engaging user experience for exploring complex ideas.
-   To build a self-contained, performant, and maintainable application using only vanilla web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS).
-   To provide clear documentation and structural plans (wireframes) that guided the development process.
