# Project: God, Consciousness, and Technology

This project provides a comprehensive, self-contained interactive web experience based on a textual analysis of the relationships between God, consciousness, and technology, particularly artificial intelligence.

## Project Components

The entire project is delivered as a single JSON object, containing all necessary files to run statically.

1.  **`index.html`**: The main hub page that links to all other parts of the project.
2.  **`/docs`**: Contains all project documentation in Markdown format, including an overview, requirements, and user flow definitions.
3.  **`/wireframes`**: Includes low-fidelity HTML wireframes to visualize the application's structure and layout before final design.
4.  **`/prototype`**: The main deliverableâ€”a fully interactive, responsive, and data-driven single-page application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It presents the core analysis in a readable and navigable format.

## How to Use

1.  **Start at the Hub**: Open `index.html` in your browser.
2.  **Explore**: Use the links to navigate to the documentation, wireframes, or the interactive prototype.
3.  **Interact**: The prototype is the centerpiece, allowing you to click through different sections of the analysis, which is dynamically loaded from a JSON data source.
